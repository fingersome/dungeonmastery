ResourceLocation takes 2 arguments: your mod id and the path to your texture file, starting from the folder 'textures/' from '/src/minecraft/assets/yourmodid/', or you can write it all as a single argument.

The texture file must be 256x256 (or multiples thereof)

If you want a texture to test out the tutorial with, I've uploaded the mana_bar.png to my github page:

The parameters for drawTexturedModalRect are as follows:

drawTexturedModalRect(int x, int y, int u, int v, int width, int height);

x and y are the on-screen position at which to render.
u and v are the coordinates of the most upper-left pixel in your texture file from which to start drawing.
width and height are how many pixels to render from the start point (u, v)
*/
// First draw the background layer. In my texture file, it starts at the upper-
// left corner (x=0, y=0), ends at 50 pixels (so it's 51 pixels long) and is 4 pixels thick (y value)
this.drawTexturedModalRect(xPos - 91 , yPos, 0, 0, 182, 5);
// Then draw the foreground; it's located just below the background in my
// texture file, so it starts at x=0, y=4, is only 2 pixels thick and 49 length
// Why y=4 and not y=5? Y starts at 0, so 0,1,2,3 = 4 pixels for the background

// However, we want the length to be based on current mana, so we need a new variable:
int lesserbarwidth = (int)(((float) props.getCurrentLesser() / props.getMaxLesser()) * 24);

// Now we can draw our mana bar at yPos+1 so it centers in the background:
this.drawTexturedModalRect(xPos - 91,  yPos, 0, 5, lesserbarwidth, 5);
